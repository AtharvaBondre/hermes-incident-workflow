# Contributing

Contributions that improve deterministic policy, isolation, verification, portability, documentation, or synthetic examples are welcome.

## Development workflow

1. Create a focused branch.
2. Keep all examples synthetic and free of customer or provider credentials.
3. Run `./scripts/run-local.sh preflight --with-docker` when Docker is available.
4. Run `./scripts/run-local.sh test`.
5. Run `python3 scripts/check-public-surface.py`.
6. For changes to the service example, run the event-indexing scenario and verify the resulting run.
7. Explain security-boundary changes explicitly in the pull request.

Do not add automatic merge, approval, deployment, production-write, or incident-mutation operations. Proposals for live connectors must begin with a threat model and a brokered least-privilege interface.
